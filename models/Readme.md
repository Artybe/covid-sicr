All models are written in Stan. The complexity of the model is coded in the name. Names all start with SICR, which forms the base of all models. Modifications include L for linear approximation, M for time dependendence on infection rate beta modeling mitigation, Q is the infectivity factor for cases, higher number means more infectivity, C means time dependence on case detection rate sigmaC, modeling change in testing or case definition, and 2R for second R compartment. Each model file includes the Stan blocks for functions, data, transformedparameters, and generated functions. To ensure uniformity between models, the likelihood and priors are also placed in include files.
